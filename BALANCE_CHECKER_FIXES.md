# Balance Checker Fixes - Comprehensive Report

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **ResourceSystem.canAfford() - Inconsistent Resource Validation**
**File:** `src/systems/resourceSystem.js:189-193`

**Problem:** The function was checking if resources were "unlocked" before allowing purchases, causing inconsistency between what the player could technically afford vs what the UI would allow.

**Fix:** Removed the unlocking check from `canAfford()` since this should be a pure availability check. UI should handle visibility separately.

```javascript
// BEFORE - Inconsistent logic
if (!state.unlockedResources[resource]) {
    console.warn(`Resource ${resource} not unlocked yet, cannot afford cost of ${required}`);
    return false;
}

// AFTER - Pure affordability check
// Note: We don't check if resource is unlocked here because canAfford should be
// a pure resource availability check. UI should handle visibility separately.
```

### 2. **ResourceSystem.canSustainBuilding() - Incorrect Rate Calculations**
**File:** `src/systems/resourceSystem.js:277-298`

**Problem:** The function was using base building rates without considering multipliers, leading to incorrect sustainability assessments that didn't match the actual consumption rates.

**Fix:** Updated to use the same multiplier calculations used everywhere else in the system.

```javascript
// BEFORE - Using raw rates
const rates = calculateRates(resource);
return rates.net - rate >= 0;

// AFTER - Using actual multiplied rates
const baseRate = definition.baseProduction;
const buildingMultiplier = UpgradeSystem.getBuildingMultiplier(buildingKey);
const globalMultiplier = UpgradeSystem.getGlobalMultiplier();
const researchBonus = ResearchSystem.getResearchBonus();
const totalMultiplier = state.globalMultiplier * buildingMultiplier * globalMultiplier * researchBonus;

const actualConsumptionRate = baseRate * rate * totalMultiplier;
return rates.net - actualConsumptionRate >= 0;
```

### 3. **SimpleTableUI.createBuildingBenefitCell() - Display vs System Mismatch**
**File:** `src/ui/SimpleTableUI.js:516-534`

**Problem:** UI was showing base rates instead of actual multiplied rates, causing confusion about what buildings actually produce/consume.

**Fix:** Updated UI display to calculate and show actual rates that match the game system.

```javascript
// BEFORE - Raw building rates
const buildingRate = building.definition.baseProduction * consumptionRate;

// AFTER - Actual multiplied rates
const buildingMultiplier = UpgradeSystem.getBuildingMultiplier(building.key);
const globalMultiplier = UpgradeSystem.getGlobalMultiplier();
const researchBonus = ResearchSystem.getResearchBonus();
const totalMultiplier = state.globalMultiplier * buildingMultiplier * globalMultiplier * researchBonus;
const actualBuildingRate = building.definition.baseProduction * consumptionRate * totalMultiplier;
```

### 4. **ResourceSystem Bottleneck Calculation - Multiplier Inconsistency**
**File:** `src/systems/resourceSystem.js:101, 119`

**Problem:** The bottleneck calculation was recalculating multipliers instead of using the already calculated `totalMultiplier`, potentially causing slight numerical differences.

**Fix:** Use the consistent `totalMultiplier` variable throughout.

```javascript
// BEFORE - Recalculated multipliers
const consumptionMultiplier = state.globalMultiplier * buildingMultiplier * globalMultiplier * researchBonus;
const requiredPerSecond = baseRate * consumptionRate * consumptionMultiplier;

// AFTER - Consistent multiplier usage
const requiredPerSecond = baseRate * consumptionRate * totalMultiplier;
```

### 5. **UI Rate Display - Production/Consumption Mismatch**
**File:** `src/ui/SimpleTableUI.js:538-576`

**Problem:** The UI was showing base rates for production and consumption instead of the actual effective rates after all multipliers.

**Fix:** Updated both production and consumption displays to show actual rates that match what the game system calculates.

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Consistency**: All rate calculations now use the same multiplier formula across all systems
2. **Separation of Concerns**: `canAfford()` is now purely about resource availability, UI handles visibility
3. **Transparency**: UI displays match actual game calculations
4. **Precision**: Consistent floating-point handling with Math.floor/Math.ceil

## Testing

Created comprehensive test files:
- `balance_checker_test.js` - Original diagnostic test
- `verify_balance_fixes.js` - Post-fix verification
- `final_balance_verification.html` - Interactive browser test with stress testing

## Impact

These fixes ensure that:
- ✅ "Available to buy" buttons are consistent with actual resource availability
- ✅ Resource production/consumption warnings accurately reflect real bottlenecks
- ✅ UI displays match the actual game calculations
- ✅ Multiple calls to the same function return consistent results
- ✅ All systems use the same mathematical logic for rate calculations

## Files Modified

1. `src/systems/resourceSystem.js` - Core affordability and sustainability logic
2. `src/ui/SimpleTableUI.js` - Display logic alignment

## Verification

Run `final_balance_verification.html` in a browser to confirm all fixes are working correctly. The test includes:
- Consistency checks across multiple function calls
- Logic validation between related functions (canAfford + canSustain = canBuild)
- Rate calculation stability tests
- Stress testing with 1000 iterations

All balance checkers should now function consistently and display accurate information to the player.
